### Project Overview: PULSE - Public Utility Ledger and Service Enabler

**PULSE** is a robust backend-driven application designed to streamline utility bill payments and invoice generation. The system efficiently manages payments for different utilities, while handling urgent requests such as overdue payments or disconnections with higher priority. Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **file handling techniques**, PULSE utilizes **data structures** like queues, priority queues, and stacks to optimize request processing and transaction history management.

This project makes use of the following concepts-

- **RESTful API Development**: Implementing endpoints for handling bill payments, generating invoices, and managing transaction history.
- **Data Structures**: Leveraging queues for sequential processing, priority queues for urgent requests, and stacks for tracking and undoing previous transactions.
- **File Handling**: Storing and exporting invoices in **PDF** and **CSV** formats, with transaction logs maintained in **JSON** files for auditing.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Ensuring smooth processing of payment requests with asynchronous operations and efficient data handling.
